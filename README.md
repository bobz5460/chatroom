Chatroom using django and websockets for instant messaging. No way to register a user without the admin console and admin has to set up each room, no encyption or anything. 
Should be relativly secure if you use https and wss, theres user authentication but idk how well that works.
Im not actively developing this, just felt like making it over a weekend.
